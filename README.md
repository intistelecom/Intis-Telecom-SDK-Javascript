```

## Requirements
The Intis-SDK-JS script requires [js-md5](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5).

## API

Use the getBalance method to request your balance status

```js
client.getBalance(function(data){ console.log(data); }, function(error){ console.log(error); });
```

To send a message (to one or several recipients), use the function send(phone, text, sender, success, error, sending_time), where phone - is a set of numbers you send your messages to, sender is a senderâ€™s name and text stands for the content of the message and sending_time - Example: 2014-05-30 14:06 (an optional parameter, it is used when it is necessary to schedule SMS messages).

```js
client.send(phone, text, sender, function(data){ console.log(data); }, function(error){ console.log(error); });
```

To receive status info for an SMS you have already sent, use the function getStatus(messageId) where messageId - is an array of sent message IDs.

```js
client.getStatus(messageId, function(data){ console.log(data); }, function(error){ console.log(error); })
```

Use the getPrices method to request your prices

```js
client.getPrices(function(data){ console.log(data); }, function(error){ console.log(error); });
```
